# YubiKit Demo

**YubiKit** is an Android library provided by Yubico to enable interaction between YubiKeys and Android devices. The library supports NFC and USB YubiKeys. The library includes a demo application. The [YubiKit Demo App](./src) in this directory provides an example for integrating and using the features of the library in an Android project.

To get started:

1. Clone the repository containing the YubiKit SDK along with this demo app.
2. Acquire a supported YubiKey: YubiKit requires a physical key to test its features.
3. Build the app using Android Studio, or directly using Gradle.

4. Start integrating the library into your own application. The YubiKit SDK is available as a multi-module library.

 - Each module has a README that provides the instructions for integrating and using that module. See the About section in the [top-level README](../README.md) for a list of the modules and links to their associated READMEs.
 - Add each module as a dependency to your Android project as needed.

5. Set up Android Debug Bridge (adb) debugging over WiFi: https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#wireless

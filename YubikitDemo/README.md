# YubiKit Demo

**YubiKit** is an Android library provided by Yubico to enable interaction between YubiKeys and Android devices. The library supports NFC-enabled and USB YubiKeys. The library includes a demo application implemented in the Kotlin playground. The [YubiKit Demo App](./src) in this directory provides a complete example for integrating and using all the features of the library in an Android project.

To get started:

1. Download the zip file containing all the required library assets.
2. Acquire a supported YubiKey: YubiKit requires a physical key to test its features.
3. Try the [YubiKit Demo App] in this directory and which is included with the library.

4. Start integrating the library into your own application. The YubiKit SDK is available as a multi-module library.

 - Each module has a README that provides the instructions for integrating and using that module. See the About section in the [top-level README](../README.md) for a list of the modules and links to their associated READMEs.
 - Add each module as a dependency to your Android project as needed.

5. Set up Android Debug Bridge (adb) debugging over WiFi: https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#wireless
